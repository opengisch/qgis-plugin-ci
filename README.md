Contains scripts to perform automated testing and deployment for QGIS plugins.
These scripts are written for and tested on GitHub, Travis-CI, github workflows and Transifex.

- Deploy plugin releases on QGIS official plugin repository
- Publish plugin in Github releases, option to deploy a custom repository
- Easily integrated in Travis-CI or github workflows
- Completely handle translations with Transifex:
  - create the project and the languages
  - pull and push translations
  - all TS/QM files can be managed on the CI, the `i18n` folder can be omitted from the Git repository
- `changelog` section in the metadata.txt can be populated if the CHANGELOG.md is present
- set the `experimental` flag according to the tag if needed

:book: For further information, see [the documentation](https://opengisch.github.io/qgis-plugin-ci/).

QGIS-Plugin-CI is best served if you use these two conventions :

- [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
- [Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com)

## Command line

```commandline
usage: qgis-plugin-ci [-h] [-v]
                      {package,changelog,release,pull-translation,push-translation}
                      ...

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         print the version and exit

commands:
  qgis-plugin-ci command

  {package,changelog,release,pull-translation,push-translation}
    package             creates an archive of the plugin
    changelog           gets the changelog content
    release             release the plugin
    pull-translation    pull translations from Transifex
    push-translation    update strings and push translations
```

## Requirements

- The code is under a **git** repository (`git archive` is used to bundle the plugin).
- There is no uncommitted changes when doing a package/release (althought there is an option to bypass this requirement).
- A configuration at the top directory either in `.qgis-plugin-ci` or in `setup.cfg` or `pyproject.toml` with a `[qgis-plugin-ci]` section (see `docs/configuration/options.md` for details).
- The source files of the plugin are within a sub-directory  with a `metadata.txt` file with the following fields:
    - description
    - qgisMinimumVersion
    - repository
	- tracker

See `parameters.py` for more parameters and details. Notice that the name of this directory will be used for the zip file.

## QRC and UI files

- Any .qrc file in the source top directory (plugin_path) will be compiled and output as filename_rc.py. You can then import it using `import plugin_path.resources_rc`
- Currently, qgis-plugin-ci does not compile any .ui file.

## Publishing plugins

When releasing, you can publish the plugin :

1. In the official QGIS plugin repository. You need to provide user name and password for your Osgeo account.
2. As a custom repository in Github releases and which can be added later in QGIS. The address will be: https://github.com/__ORG__/__REPO__/releases/latest/download/plugins.xml

Both can be achieved in the same process.

## Pre-release and experimental

In the case of a pre-release (either from the tag name according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) or from the GitHub release), the plugin will be flagged as experimental.

The tool will recognise any label use as a suffix to flag it as pre-release :

- `10.1.0-beta1`
- `3.4.0-rc.2`

## Debug

In any Python module, you can have a global variable as `DEBUG = True`, which will be changed to `False` when packaging the plugin.

## Other tools

### QGIS-Plugin-Repo

QGIS-Plugin-CI can generate the `plugins.xml` file, per plugin.
If you want to merge many XML files into one to have a single QGIS plugin repository providing many plugins,
you should check [QGIS-Plugin-Repo](https://github.com/3liz/qgis-plugin-repo).
It's designed to run on CI after QGIS-Plugin-CI.
